## 🔍 Project Overview

This project presents a complete BI&A prototype designed for **Nike**, a global leader in sportswear and footwear. The project follows the full BI pipeline – from business analysis and KPI definition to data modeling, dashboard creation, and advanced analytics.

We simulated realistic organizational data and built an end-to-end analytical system aimed at supporting data-driven decision-making for marketing, operations, and sales optimization.

## Project Structure

### Part 1 – Business Understanding & Data Modeling
- Nike’s competitive analysis using **Porter’s 5 Forces**
- Definition of business processes and decision needs
- Data schema designed in **Star Schema** format
- Creation of **fact** and **dimension** tables: Customers, Products, Orders, Employees, etc.
- Structured data preparation using Excel

---

### Part 2 – Traditional BI Tools
Built using **Tableau**:
- **Dashboards**: Interactive KPI dashboards for executives
- **Customer Preferences Report**: Analyze behavior by product category, gender, and region
- **Order Management Report**: Operational view for inventory, delivery efficiency, and regional sales
- **OLAP** exploration for multidimensional analysis

---

### Part 3 – Advanced BI Applications
Developed using **Excel, R, and Python**:
- **Statistical Hypothesis Testing**:
  - Correlation between product price and purchase volume
  - Seasonal impact on sales (ANOVA)
  - Relationship between customer age/gender and revenue
- **Predictive Modeling**:
  - Built a **Linear Regression Model** to predict yearly product sales per country
  - Identified key predictors (age group, membership, online behavior)
  - Achieved high R² (0.97) and low RMSE (~0.87)

## 💡 Key KPIs Defined
- **Annual Income Growth**
- **Online Income Share**
- **Late Order Rate**
